WorldPost(R) Messaging Server version 10

WPX-WorldPost Messaging Server was the popular commercial email server system in China before 2009. 
Of cause, its' glory has gone. Instead of building compex email system by themselves, enterprises and organizations have been outsourcing email service to ISPs or SaaS provider. 

As the former owner, architect and lead developer, I put part of the source code to Github for sharing it with my dear past team mates. For keeping, for researching and for memory recalling.
