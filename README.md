WorldPost(R) Messaging Server version 10

(app source code only, unit testing code removed, delopyment tools removed)

WPX-WorldPost Messaging Server was one of the most market-occupancy commercial email server system in China before 2009. 
Of cause, its' glory has gone. Instead of building compex email system by themselves, enterprises and organizations have been outsourcing email service to ISPs or SaaS providers. 

As the former owner, architect and lead developer, I put part of the source code to Github for sharing it with my dear past team mates. For keeping, for researching and for memory recalling.
